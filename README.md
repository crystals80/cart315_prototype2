# CART 315 Exploration Prototype 2

<b>Design Hypothesis</b>  

<br>

By presenting to the player a simple simulation with one solution to complete it, if I set a timer of 30 seconds, then will the player be able to complete the simulation without getting distracted?

<br>

<b>List of questions for playtesters</b>
<ol><li>Since you did not have any instruction, what was the first thing you wanted to do?</li>
    <li>Which potion was more appealing to you? *Why did you aim for the green/blue/red potion?</li> 
    <li>Did the timer stress you out?</li> 
    <li>Were the controls too sensitive?</li></ol> 


*If the player did decide to aim for a specific potion
